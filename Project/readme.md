## Team 14 Project
To start our game open a terminal and execute `python main.py` in the `Project_Linus.Prange_Luca.Pomm_Daniel.Shaw_Nils Schiele` folder.
In our game you can execute the other games if their are integrated correctly in the `/games` folder.
You also can finish our game by going doing some activities and understanding the text on the gate.

All games can be added by putting them into their folders in games and then adding the relevant data into the eventStoneData.json file.

-> An easy example is the provided ingame folders `team13_0` and `team13_1`


#### Games Integrated ####
To install libs for most games use the requirements.txt file, like `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Group 15 uses tkinter which needs to be installed manualy `sudo apt install python3-tk` (only tested on linux).
