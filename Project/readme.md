## Team 14 Project
Tested on python3.11 use this version or higher, and install the following libs
 for most games use the requirements.txt file, like `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Group 15 uses tkinter which needs to be installed manualy `sudo apt install python3-tk` (only tested on linux).
Happy playing (if help is needed send an email)
