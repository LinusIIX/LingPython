Dothraki Numbers Learning Game Description:
This is a fun and interactive game designed to help players learn the Dothraki numbers from 0 to 19. The game presents the player with a number in either Dothraki or English, and the player has to correctly identify the translation.

Key Features:
Game Mechanics:
The game generates random questions, asking either "What is [number] in Dothraki?" or "What is [Dothraki number] in English?".
The user must select the correct translation from four possible answers.
The number options presented are randomized, ensuring variety in each game session.
The game dynamically adjusts the number of English and Dothraki options based on the player's score.
The game removes the number from the list when the player answers correctly on the first try.
When the player answers a number incorrectly, the number appears later again.

Scoring System:
The game keeps track of the player's score, with a correct answer granting a point.
The game shows a popup message after each answer indicating whether the player was correct or incorrect, this popup closes automatically after a moment.
The score is updated in real-time and is displayed on the window.
The score is increased when the correct answer is chosen on first try.
No deduction or restriction on scoring for previously incorrect attempts, on later tries.
Players can keep trying without being penalized.

Difficulty Adjustment:
At higher scores, the game uses more difficult combinations of numbers and words.
As the player proceeds, the game increases in difficulty by increasing the number of words shown, instead of numbers.
Easy mode: There are 3 digits and 1 Dothraki word if the digit is shown, or only digits, if the Dothraki word is shown.
Over time the amount of digits decrease and the amount of Dothraki words increase, making the game periodically harder.
This means that as the player performs better, they are given fewer English number options, forcing them to recall more Dothraki words.

Game Flow:
Start Screen: When the game starts, the player is presented with the title "Learn Dothraki Numbers" and a question.
Answer Selection: The player selects one of the four presented answers.
Feedback: A popup message indicates if the answer was correct or incorrect.
Next Question: Once the answer is processed, a new question is generated, and the process repeats.
End of Game: The game continues until the player decides to close the window or the player answers all questions correctly.
