Letter Hunter Team 5: Selin Kumbasar and Anna-Lena Gensle, former member Berrak Daglioglu

Pleaser make sure to decompress the Zip file and check the working directory before running the code.
The code just runs in the GameEngineInterface Integration.
We run the game in Python 3.12 and on Windows 11.

The game we designed is a three level letter hunter game based on the Wormy game by AI Sweigart.You can play three levels and learn about
dothraki words, a language from Game of Thrones. In the end you learn the translation of the word 'ahhaz' what was our groups clue.

Have fun,

Anna-Lena and Selin
